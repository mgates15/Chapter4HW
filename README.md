Chapter 4 Homework


"9." mysterySum(0) is equal to 0. mysterySum(1) is equal to 3+0=3. We conintue this process until we reach mysterySum(5) which is 15 because mysterySum(4) is equal to 12. 

"11." We know that 7 multiplications are performed originally because power3(15) will become 3^7. There are 
also two more multiplications that take place are when p n is halved (division is multiplaction of the inverse)
and also when the value of p is squared. That makes a total of 9 multiplications. 

"18." If we split up 81 into groups of 3, there are 4 groups. Why use groups of 3? Because we can find infer if
one coin is lighter by comparing it to the other 2. Therefore, it only take a total of 4 trials. 

What is a Search Function?

A search function is a function used to find a value in a list. A search function uses a particular algorithm
to search for the value it is looking for. A sequential search is rather inefficient for larger lists, and 
will scan through all items of the list if necessary. The binary search function is far more efficient for 
larger lists. It uses the midpoint of a list and keeps dividing the range of values smaller and smaller until
it finally finds the particular value.
